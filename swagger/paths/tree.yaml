    summary: Query a portion of the flywheel hierarchy, returning only the requested fields.
    description: |
      This is a build-your-own request endpoint that can fetch from anywhere in the hierarchy,
      returning just the fields that you care about.

      # Fields
      Each fetch-level described must include a list of fields to return. These fields
      can be anything on the container (except info), and will be included in the response
      if they are present in the container.

      # Joins
      Children or parents can be joined as part of this request, by specifying an additional
      subdocument of the given name. Check /tree/graph for a list of containers and their
      connections.

      # Filter
      Joined documents can be further filtered (with the exception of inputs & files) by
      passing a filter in the subdocument. Filtering follows the same convention as top-level
      pagination.

      # Sort
      Joined documents can be sorted as well, following the convention as top-level pagination.

      # Limit
      Joins can be limited to a the first N documents by specifying a limit in the subdocument.

      # Join-origin
      Passing `true` for the `join-origin` flag in the files subdocument will populates the
      `join-origin` map for each container with files.
